# Glorious

A crude command-line application for:

1. class-dump'ing any SenTestingKit.framework or XCTest.framework headers
   packaged with a version of Xcode.
2. Copying public headers from any SenTestingKit or XCTest framework packaged
   with a version of Xcode.

Edit the included Xcode schemes to modify command-line arguments.

This code is awful. Don't use it.
