# Glorious

A crude script for class-dump'ing any SenTestingKit.framework or
XCTest.framework headers packaged with a version of Xcode.

```
$ ./Glorious.swift \
    /usr/local/bin/class-dump \             # Path to class-dump executable
    /Applications/Xcode.app \               # Path to Xcode
    /Users/modocache/GitHub/XCTest-Headers  # Path to output directory
```

This code is awful. Don't use it.
